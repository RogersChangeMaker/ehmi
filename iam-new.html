                HEBREWS 9:27-28 “And just as it is destined
             that each person dies only one time and after
            that comes judgment, so also CHRIST JESUS 
            died only one time as a sacrifice to take
            away the sins of many people. JESUS will come 
            again but not to deal with our sins again. 
            This time He will bring salvation to all those
            who are eagerly waiting for Him.” 

            </p>   <br/><br/>
My dear brother, my dear sister, one day you will
die and leave this world. Regardless of how you are
living your life today, whether in riches or in poverty
you will someday die.
Then you will meet your creator: GOD Almighty, to judge 
you of how you lived on earth. <br/>Where will you spend 
eternity after judgment? In Heaven with the LORD or in 
Hell Fire with the Satan?<br/>
The only way to be sure of heaven is to believe in JESUS and
 invite Him into your heart as your LORD and SAVIOR. 
He died on the cross to take away your sins so that you may
 live a righteous life; so today is your opportunity to make peace with the LORD.<br/><br/>
Romans 10:9-10 "For if you confess with your mouth that JESUS
is LORD and believe in your heart that GOD raised Him from the
dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart
that you are made right with GOD, and it is by confessing with 
your mouth that you are saved."
<br/><br/>
So, make this short prayer of confession: LORD JESUS, I INVITE YOU INTO 
MY HEART, TO BE MY LORD AND SAVIOR. IN JESUS NAME. AMEN.
        </h3>
