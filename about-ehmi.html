            Eternal Hope Ministries International
            was conceived in the place of prayer through
            a deep undying passion for souls.
            While the founder (Rev Wase Rogers) was spending
            some time in prayer, the LORD laid in his heart a 
            passion for souls by asking him a question:
            <p class="question-background">"Are you aware that Asia 
                that has 2/3 of the world's
             population is the least reached place with the gospel?"</p>
             <br/> This question from the LORD gave Rev Wase the task to 
             start praying for a clear vision on how to satisfy the 
             LORD'S concern. Then in the year 2020 the LORD gave him 
             the name Eternal Hope Ministries International as a means 
             of fulfilling the mandate.
             Him and his wife needed an Asian experience, so they sold 
             everything they had and traveled first to Bahrain (Middle East Asia)
              in February 2022 where they
             began a work, planted two fellowships of about 25 people. 
             Rev Wase returned to Cameroon in February 2023 while his
              wife remained in Bahrain to consolidate the work, do some job to support 
              him as he prepared to launch to Philippines that the LORD laid 
              in their hearts. Rev Wase then traveled to Philippines in 
              November 2024 to start the work in all its fulness and his wife
               later on joined him in May 2025.
